Getting Started with Git.

git config --global user.name "piyushkumar236"
git config --global user.email "piyushvit2007@gmail.com"
git clone https://github.com/piyushkumar236/TestGitHub.git [one time activity]

git status
git add README.md
git commit -m "Updated the README.md file for better description"
git log
git status

git remote add origin https://github.com/piyushkumar236/TestGitHub.git
git push -u origin master			



Undo git add : 	git rm --cached <added_file_to_undo>			<check git status before and after this command to see the difference>



Adding or Committing a directory is same as commiting a file.
git add directory_name 	<However, if some problem is there even in one file while adding as "Permission Denied", it will not add the entire directory>
git commit -m ""

1. Open Git shell.
	Windows PowerShell
	Copyright (C) 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
	
	C:\Users\piyushk> git config --global user.name "piyushkumar236"
	C:\Users\piyushk> git config --global user.email "piyushvit2007@gmail.com"
	
2.	Go to the website. Create Repositories. Ignore means you can ignore changes made by friends.
	
	HTTPS clone url - 	https://github.com/piyushkumar236/TestGitHub.git
	
3. 	Go to the Git Shell.
	cd .\Desktop
	git clone https://github.com/piyushkumar236/TestGitHub.git
	clear
	cd TestGitHub
	vi README.md ( or open this file using notepad++)
	edit the file and now, if we want to upload the file to the same in the server.

4.	Check the status of the file.

		C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master +0 ~1 -0]> git status
		On branch master
		Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
		
		Changes not staged for commit:
		(use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
		(use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
		
				modified:   README.md
				
		no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
		C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master +0 ~1 -0]>

** git push -help, git commit -help ...		
		
5.			
		git add README.md
		git commit -m "Updated the README.md file for better description"
		git log
		git status
			C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master]> git status
			On branch master
			Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
			(use "git push" to publish your local commits)
			
			nothing to commit, working directory clean				>>nothign to commit, means all the local changes are  already committed.
			C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master]>
			
		git remote add origin https://github.com/piyushkumar236/TestGitHub.git	(step not required, if we have cloned the respository to local directory)
		git status
		git push -u origin master			<<< pushing to main branch ( master)
			provide username and password (if asked for)
		
		The file with the changes is pushed to the central repository.
		
6. 	If we have to add a new file from a local directory in our desktop to the central repository.
		create a file and edit it(using vi or notepad++)
		git status
			C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master +1 ~0 -0 !]> git status
			On branch master
			Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
			
			Untracked files:
			(use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
			
					testfile.txt
			
			nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)			
			C:\Users\piyushk\Desktop\TestGitHub [master +1 ~0 -0 !]>
		
		git add .		>> for files that are not being tracked.
		git commit -m "adding new file to repository."
		git status
		git push				(since we have already done git push -u origin master, hence not requried again)
		
7.	To get the new files, which might have been uploaded by other people.
		git pull origin master
